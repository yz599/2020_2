ML -Looking for Joint probability model  
Continued lecture 1 and 2

## 2. Machine learning and joint distribution
Machine learning is looking for a conditional probability P(Y|X) by finding joint distribution

_**The 4th column shows share of the examples and hence the table is actually a dataset..**_

> <font color='red'>The joint distribution allows us to compute the joint probability/marginal prob and hence conditional prob P(Y|X)

1.	Suppose we want to learn the function f: <G, H> â€”>W >>

2.	Equivalently, P(W | G, H)   Solution: learn joint distribution from data, calculate P(W | G, H)   

e.g., P(W=rich | G = female, H = 40.5)= ![](.ML_probability_images/8da29a62.png)
